#####  Flutter is a dynamic platform that allows individuals to develop responsive cross-platform applications. Not only is flutter incredibly easy to get hold of but the extensive development documentation available online makes working with Flutter incredibly convenient. Flutter also allows the app's interface to be consistent across various platforms like iOS, and Android. Dart is the backbone of flutter and it utilizes a combination of java and javascript.

 I actually agree with your thoughts on Flutter. The possibility that it is easier to grasp than other frameworks gives it an edge for sure, plus I believe Dart has a similar syntax to Java, which allows Java developers to learn it very quickly. However, while Flutter may be a very good framework, I would also recommend if you look into React Native for Cross Platform Application development.
